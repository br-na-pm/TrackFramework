# Overview

The AcpTrak Paper widget library provides a convenient wrapper to automatically build the SVG strings for an entire trak system for the paper widget. The library utilizes the prebuilt SVG from the trak system (post processed) in combination with acp trak status blocks to build a simple drop in widget to show the status of an acp trak system. Additionally it is augmented with optional features such as showing the location of shuttles on the system.
